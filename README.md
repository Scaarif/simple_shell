Simple Shell Project
#Decription:
This is a basic emulation of the bash shell, in fulfillment of the first
sprint's final project requirements. While the most common features have been implemented, a lot else remains undone. (Maybe something I can look into on a later date just for the fun of it!)

#Usage:
Once main is up and running, it takes commands the same way bash does.
> $ compile all .c files to get it up and running (gcc #options# *.c -o simple_shell
Then continue to use like any bash shell
